## Contents

- **Causality_Notebook.ipynb** - Main Jupyter notebook with theory, code examples, and visualizations
- **Example1_Dataset/** - First worked example demonstrating causal analysis
- **Example2_Dataset/** - Second worked example on a different dataset
- **QuizQuestions.md** - 15 multiple-choice questions testing causal inference concepts
- **Video_Link.txt** - Link to video presentation
- **README.md** - This file

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```
python >= 3.8
jupyter notebook
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
```

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook Causality_Notebook.ipynb`

## Project Structure

### Jupyter Notebook
The main notebook covers:
- Foundational concepts in causal inference
- Data preparation techniques for causal analysis
- Practical code examples with clear documentation
- Visualizations (DAGs, effect estimates, distributions)
- Real-world applications

### Worked Examples
Two complete causal analyses on different datasets:
1. **Example 1**: Heart Disease Dataset
2. **Example 2**: Liver Disease Dataset

### Quiz Questions
15 questions covering key topics:
- Confounding and causal graphs
- Propensity score matching
- Instrumental variables
- Difference-in-differences
- Causal assumptions and identification
